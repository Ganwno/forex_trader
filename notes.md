TO DO:

1. Add redux reducers funtions, the one that you can start with is the Chart functionality. Transport the api data transformation into separate reducer function and use parameters to mutate the data

2. Add another reducer that take care of the wallet section. This reducer should keep the informations about how much of which currency user has

3. Another reducer and slice that is necessary is the transactions history reducer. Each transaction has to be transformed into an object that contains informations such as date, which currency has been sold, which currency has been bought, the date and the total amount

4. Max Schwarzmuller' section 19 of React course has some important info about redux methodology, so remember to use it as a source.
